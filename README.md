# STAT
An addon that enables 1 macro status removal with the help of send.

STAT is a heavily modified version of STNA for FFXI (https://github.com/nitrous24/Lua/tree/4.1/addons/stna)

Since it's so heavily modified I felt a the original name did not cover it anymore.

Where STNA only dealth with -na spells STAT deals with ALL spells that a whm can remove through -NA spells and ERASE

If you get charmed and you use the command you will get reposed by your alt (if they're a WHM or /WHM)

If you get doomed the command will also automatically lets your character use holy waters

Has only one command: //stat
